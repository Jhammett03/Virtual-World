World Event: Portals!

The portal entity is a new type of environmental entity which makes the other Moving entities like the Dude and Fairy
teleport to another linked portal

HOW IT WORKS:
The portal entity uses a mouseclicked operator to place a portal in a desired location in the virtual world
If only one portal is placed, the teleportation destination will be the same location as the portal, however for every
portal placed after that the portal is linked to the previous portal.

For Example:
portal1 -> portal1 (if only one portal exists)

portal2 -> portal1 and
portal1 -> portal2 (if 2 exist)

portal3 -> portal2
portal2 -> portal3
portal1 -> portal2 (for 3)

etc...

HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE OTHER ENTITIES?
The portals affect the moving entities by teleporting them to a different section of the world. They do not impact the
functionality of the other entities, but if their pathing happens to direct them through a portal, then they will get
thrown off their path and need to restart their pathing.


New Moving Entity: Zombies
placing portals will allow zombies to pass into the virtual world from the other side, one zombie will appear whenever a
portal is placed

FUNCTIONALITY:
Zombies path to the dudes and attempt to eat them, if a zombie is within range of a dude then he will kill him and find
a new target
